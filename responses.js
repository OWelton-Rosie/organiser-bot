So be it. Time to organise one yourself. 
(A brief guide for the eternally unimpressed.)

**1. Find a venue**
You want better comps? Start by finding a large open space. It should have around 4m² per competitor. Go beyond what you can find through Google. Places without a "Venue hire" page on their website are likely to be significantly cheaper than those that do.

**2. Contact your local delegate**
Tell them what you want to do (date, venue, events, etc), and pretend you've got a decent idea of the details. Oh so, you've only got complaints? Maybe don't email just yet.

**3. Find a WCA Delegate**
Without a Delegate, you can't have a competition. Delegates are volunteers, not your personal competition slave.
You could try SEEK, but https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/delegates might be more effective.`,
