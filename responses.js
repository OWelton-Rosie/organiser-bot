__So you think all the current comps suck?__
So be it. Time to organise one yourself. 
(A brief guide for the eternally unimpressed.)

**1. Find a venue**
You want better comps? Start by finding a large open space. It should have around 4m² per competitor. 
Go beyond what you can find through Google. Places *without* a "Venue hire" page on their website are likely to be significantly cheaper than those that do. 

**2. Contact your local delegate**
Tell them what you want to do (date, venue, events, etc), and pretend you've got a decent idea of the details. 
Oh so, you've only got complaints? Maybe don't email just yet.

**3. Find a WCA Delegate**
Without a Delegate, you can't have a competition. Delegates are volunteers, not your personal competition slave.
You could try SEEK, but <https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/delegates> will probably be more effective. 

**4. Work with your delegate**
They will help you build a schedule that makes sense and will work. 
As you'll be shocked to hear, you can't only have 7x7 and 4x4 BLD. 
Trust the process.

**5. Run the comp**
On the day of the comp, arrive early (generally, about an hour early) and help with venue setup. Do the things your Delegate asks you to. Don't be an inconvenience.
Try not to be the problem you spend all your free time complaining about. If nothing else, being the problem you complain about is just plain ironic.

**6. Clean up**
Tables and chairs go back. Make the venue look how it looked when you walked in.
Empty the rubbish bins. Don't ghost - be helpful.
Congrats. You've officially done more than complain. 

Maybe now you'll understand why competition feedback can't just be "just make the comps better".
